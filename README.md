# VHDL Hardware Design Projects on Vivado

This repository includes a collection of hardware design projects developed in **VHDL** using **Xilinx Vivado**. The work focuses on core architectural and implementation techniques for digital systems, with practical applications targeting **FPGAs** and specifically **ZYNQ SoC** platforms.

## Topics Covered

### ðŸ”¹ Hierarchical Design of Arithmetic Units
This topic explores the modular and hierarchical construction of arithmetic units

### ðŸ”¹ Pipelined Hardware Design
This section includes hardware modules that demonstrate the technique of **pipelining**, aiming to improve throughput and clock frequency. Designs include pipelined adders and multipliers.

### ðŸ”¹ FIR Filter with AXI Interface for ZYNQ SoC
A complete implementation of a **Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter** using VHDL, designed to interface with a **ZYNQ SoC** via the **AXI4-Lite** and **AXI4-Stream** protocols.
